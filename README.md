# Description
This project was created as a desktop application in WPF. The idea of this application is to create a centralized learning database client, where teachers can create tests and monitor student progress, and students can easily pass them.

The application is based on the .NET Core 6 platform. I also developed 4 of my own libraries to make it easier to create applications in WPF. In particular, ConcurrentObservableCollectionHelpersLibrary, HelperDialogsLibrary,
MvvmBaseViewModelsLibrary, WpfBackgroundWorkerLibrary, WpfDefaultNumericToStringConvertersLibrary.

EntityFramework Core was used to communicate with the database. Database - MSSQL.
